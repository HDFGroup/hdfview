# Phase 1 Task 2: Future Cross-Platform and UI Testing Tasks

## Overview
This document contains deferred testing tasks for comprehensive SWT platform support validation. These tasks should be executed after Phase 1 completion to ensure full cross-platform functionality.

## Cross-Platform Testing Tasks

### Task: Windows Platform Testing
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: Windows development environment or CI runner

**Subtasks**:
1. **Profile Activation Testing**
   - Verify `swt-windows` profile activates on Windows OS
   - Check `mvn help:active-profiles` shows correct profile
   - Validate `${os.arch}` resolution (x86_64 vs aarch64)

2. **Dependency Resolution Testing**
   - Run `mvn dependency:tree` on Windows
   - Verify `org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_64` is resolved
   - Check no Linux/macOS SWT artifacts are included

3. **Build Testing**
   - Execute `mvn clean compile` on Windows
   - Verify compilation succeeds
   - Check HDFView.class is generated

4. **ARM64 Support (Future)**
   - Test on Windows ARM64 systems
   - Verify `org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.aarch64` resolution
   - Add architecture detection if needed

### Task: macOS Platform Testing
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: macOS development environment or CI runner

**Subtasks**:
1. **Profile Activation Testing**
   - Verify `swt-mac` profile activates on macOS
   - Test both Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (aarch64)
   - Check profile activation logic works correctly

2. **Dependency Resolution Testing**
   - Intel Macs: Verify `org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.x86_64`
   - Apple Silicon: Verify `org.eclipse.swt.cocoa.macosx.aarch64`
   - Check no other platform SWT artifacts included

3. **Build Testing**
   - Execute full build on both Intel and Apple Silicon
   - Verify Cocoa integration works
   - Test application packaging for macOS

### Task: Linux Architecture Testing
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Linux ARM64 system access

**Subtasks**:
1. **ARM64 Profile Addition**
   - Add Linux aarch64 architecture detection
   - Configure `org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.aarch64` dependency
   - Test profile activation on ARM64 Linux

2. **Multi-Architecture Build Matrix**
   - Test x86_64 and aarch64 builds
   - Verify no architecture conflicts
   - Document platform-specific requirements

## UI Functionality Testing Tasks

### Task: Basic SWT Widget Testing
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: Display/X11 environment or headless testing setup

**Subtasks**:
1. **HDFView Launch Testing**
   - Test basic application startup on each platform
   - Verify main window creation
   - Check menu and toolbar rendering

2. **Core UI Components**
   - Test file browser functionality
   - Verify data table (NatTable) rendering
   - Check dialog boxes and modals

3. **Platform-Specific Features**
   - Windows: Test native file dialogs
   - macOS: Test menu bar integration
   - Linux: Test GTK theme integration

### Task: Advanced UI Integration Testing
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Sample HDF files, comprehensive test suite

**Subtasks**:
1. **File Operations Testing**
   - Open HDF4/HDF5 files on each platform
   - Test file tree navigation
   - Verify data viewing functionality

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Large file loading performance
   - UI responsiveness during data operations
   - Memory usage across platforms

3. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard navigation
   - High contrast theme support

## CI/CD Integration Tasks

### Task: Automated Cross-Platform Builds
**Priority**: High (Phase 2 dependency)
**Dependencies**: GitHub Actions or similar CI system

**Subtasks**:
1. **Build Matrix Configuration**
   - Configure Linux, Windows, macOS runners
   - Set up platform-specific build environments
   - Add ARM64 runners when available

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Headless UI testing setup
   - Dependency validation scripts
   - Build artifact verification

3. **Release Automation**
   - Platform-specific packaging
   - Native installer generation
   - Cross-platform deployment

### Task: Quality Assurance Integration
**Priority**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 quality tools

**Subtasks**:
1. **Static Analysis Across Platforms**
   - Ensure SpotBugs works on all platforms
   - Platform-specific exclusion rules
   - Quality gate consistency

2. **Test Coverage Validation**
   - Cross-platform test execution
   - Coverage aggregation across platforms
   - Platform-specific test requirements

## Implementation Notes
