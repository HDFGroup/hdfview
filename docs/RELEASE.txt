HDF Libraries
=============================================================================
This release was built and tested with HDF 4.2.16 and HDF5 1.14.2.

Windows ONLY: HDFView built with VS 2015 will require that
the Visual C++ Redistributable Packages be installed on your machine.
If you cannot access HDF5 files then you do not have these packages.
You can obtain them from:
         https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145


JDK
=============================================================================
This release was built and tested with OpenJDK 19. It uses modules and the
newest jpackage for distribution.

Major Enhancements
==============================================================================
    * GH #121 Updated all icons with transpareancy

Major Bug Fixes
==============================================================================
    * GH #119 (crashes opening HDF4 file) has been fixed. The problem was
      that the HDF4 xdr.dll file was not copied from the hdf4 install location.

    ***** Previous fixes *****
    * HDFVIEW-284 (crashes on NETCDF-4 grids) has been fixed. The problem was
      that references in variable-length containers were trying to be handled
      like strings. Upon investigation, the problem was found to extend to 
      references in any container. The table display code for vlen references
      also changed to account for the hdf5 Java API fixes.
      The fix required that variable-length types in the Java wrappers in the
      hdf5 library for read and write also be fixed.

      HDFView-221 Add support for true Variable-length types in Java
      Sub-issue HDFView-222 fixed the read/write support for variable-length
      in the Java wrappers. This fix involved handling the data object as
      a list of lists and using the datatype of the list.
      Sub-issue HDFView-222 fixed the object library to handle the List of Lists
      concept.
      Sub-issue HDFView-223 updated the DataProviders, DataDisplayConverters
      and DataValidators to work with variable-length List of Lists.

Minor Bug Fixes
==============================================================================
    * Corrected how the program updates changes to the fonts made in the User Preferences
      dialog. There are still issues with having to trigger a visual refresh.

    * GH #73 (Check aarch64 in machine.arch property) fixed by adding a section to
      for aarch64.

    * GH #147 (HDFView 3.3.0 shows incorrect references in compound types in datasets)
      fixed by adding a start index into the object reference array of data read from a
      compound type.

Limitations / Known Problems
==============================================================================
    * HDFView currently cannot nicely handle large datasets when using the
      default display mode, as the data is loaded in its entirety. To view
      large datasets, it is recommended to right click on a data object and
      use the "Open As" menu item, where a subset of data to view can be
      selected.

    * HDFView also cannot nicely handle large numbers of objects, because of
      a design issue that requires HDFView to visit all the objects in a file.

    * Object/region references can't be opened by a double-click or by
      right-clicking and choosing "Show As Table/Image" when inside a compound
      datatype.

    * If a file is opened in read-only mode, right-clicking on a dataset in
      in the tree view and choosing any of the options under the
      "Export Dataset" menu item will fail with a message of
      'Unable to export dataset: Unable to open file'. The current workaround
      is to re-open the file in read/write mode.

    * The 'Recent Files' button does not work on Mac due to a cross-platform
      issue with SWT.

    * Selecting and changing individual points in PaletteView for an image
      palette is broken.

    * Logging and optional HDF4 requires rebuilds from source.

    * Automatically opening HDFView and displaying a file selected still does display
    the file on a mac.
