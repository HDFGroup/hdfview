<h2> <a name="ug04overview" id="ug04overview"></a>4.1 Overview</h2>
<p>The Tree Viewer (or panel) shows the objects in each open file, and supports
  the navigation and
  editing of those objects. Multiple files can be viewed and edited, and both
  HDF4 and HDF5 files can be opened. The viewing and editing operations work
  for both HDF4 and HDF5, although some operations cannot be implemented for
  HDF4.</p>

<p>Every HDF5 object appears in at least one group. A set of objects can be
stored together in a group. You can use the group object API functions
to create and manipulate the groups. With the groups, you can organize
the data objects in an HDF file. Objects in HDF4 may or may not belong to
a group. An object that does not belong to any group is called a lone object,
such as lone Vdata. To map HDF4 structure to HDF5 structure, a
&ldquo;dummy&rdquo; root
group is created in the tree view and lone objects are put at the root group.</p>

<p>Since objects can have names in more than one group, the set of all
objects in an HDF file is a directed graph. It is difficult to manipulate
and browse the graph on a 2-D virtual screen. Instead of showing the directed
graph of the HDF file structure, HDFView displays HDF objects in a conventional
structure as a tree of &ldquo;folders,&rdquo; breaking the &ldquo;loops&rdquo;
in the graph when
necessary. The tree viewer of HDFView provides users an easy way to browse
and manage HDF data objects in an HDF file. The following icons are used to
represent HDF objects:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li2"><img src="images/icon_hdf4.gif"> --- HDF4 file</li>
<li class="li2"><img src="images/icon_hdf5.gif"> --- HDF5 file</li>

<h2>
4.2 Tree Structure</h2>
<p>
Upon opening an HDF file, HDFView displays the tree structure of the HDF
file in the tree viewer, which is the left panel in  the HDFView window. Every
HDF file has exactly one root group that is created when the file is created.
The root group is added to the root of the tree. When two or more files are
open, the root groups of the files are listed at the root in the tree view.</p>

<p>Groups are presented as folders in the tree viewer. Opening and closing
folders, you can browse the individual HDF objects in the HDF file. Datasets,
images and tables are leaf objects in the tree. Double clicking a leaf object allows
you to see the content of the object displayed in a data/document window. </p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/treeview.png" />
<br />
<b>The tree viewer</b></p>
</center>


<h2>
<a name="ug04data"></a>4.3 View Data Content</h2>
<p>
The Tree View allows the user to navigate the structure of the HDF file,
to select individual objects, and to view the content of the selected object.</p>

<p>
You can open a data object in the tree by a double-mouse-click or selecting the
&ldquo;Open&rdquo; command from the object's popup menu (accessed by right clicking
on the object). By default, data content is displayed as an image, a table or text
based on its datatype. See the following chapters for a detailed discussion of the
data viewers.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/menupopup.png" />
<br /><b>The object popup menu</b></p></center>


<p>
If the data value is not in memory, the &ldquo;Open&rdquo; action will load
the data from the file and display it. If the data is already loaded into
memory, it will just display the data. If you want to refresh data in memory
or open a dataset with a different selection (subset or display option),
you have to use the &ldquo;Open As&rdquo; command.</p>

<p>
Using &ldquo;Open As&rdquo;, you can select a subset of the dataset to
display or change the default display options. For example, you can display
the data values of an image in a spreadsheet, or show a scalar dataset
as an image. For multi-dimension datasets, you can select any of two
dimensions to display. The mouse-drag navigator allows you to select a
subset by dragging the mouse over the preview image. For more details
about how to select a subset and dimensions, see
<a href="ug05spreadsheet.html#ug05subset">5.2 Subset and Dimension Selection</a>.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;Start&rdquo; field(s) determines the starting coordinate of
the selected area.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;End&rdquo; field(s) determines the ending coordinate of the
selected area.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Stride&rdquo; field(s) chooses array locations from the
dataspace with each value in the stride array determining how many
elements to move in each dimension. Setting a value in the stride array
to 1 moves to each element in that dimension of the dataspace; setting a
value of 2 in the stride array moves to every other element in that
dimension of the dataspace. In other words, the stride determines the
number of elements to move from the start location in each dimension.
Stride values of 0 are not allowed. If the stride parameter is NULL, a contiguous
hyperslab is selected (as if each value in the stride array was set to
all 1's).</p>

<h3>
<a name="ug04bitmask"></a>4.3.1 Show Bit Values</h3>

<p />
HDFView allows users to view bit values of integers in two ways:
<ul>
    <li> applying a bitmask to data values </li>
    <li> showing values of selected bits</li>
</ul>

<p />
The figure below shows the GUI layout of the two options:
<center>
</p><img src="images/bitmask_options.png" />
<br /><b>The bitmask options</b></p></center>
<p />
Applying a bitmask means to use the bitwise operation &#39;AND&#39; to the original data. For example,
<br /><img src="images/bitmask_and.png" />

<P />
Showing values of selected bits means to apply the bitmask to the data and throw
away any unnecessary bits that are not selected by the bitmask, i.e. the &#39;0&#39; bits
in the bitmask. In most of the cases, this will be the beginning and ending &#39;0&#39; bits
in the bitmask. For example,
<br /><img src="images/bitmask_extract.png" />
<p />
For the current implementation, only contiguous bits are allowed when the option of
"Show Value of Selected Bits" is selected.
<p />


<h2>
<a name="ug04metadata"></a>4.4 Display Metadata and Attributes</h2>
<p>
The metadata of an object appears by selecting the object (icon) in the tree.
  The metadata panel is the right panel in the HDFView window where the metadata content of objects are displayed in
  a tabbed view. The &ldquo;Object Attribute Info&rdquo; tab displays a list of attributes attached to the selected
  object. The attribute name, type, size and a short sample of data is displayed. Double-clicking on an attribute
  line will open a Data window for the selected attribute. There is an &ldquo;Add Attribute&rdquo; button to create a new attribute attached to
  the currently selected object in the treeview. And a &ldquo;Delete Attribute&rdquo; button to remove the selected attribute.<br />
  The &ldquo;General Object Info&rdquo; tab displays various object information such as names of objects, member names and types,
  or paths, type and version bounds for file types.
</p>

<p>General metadata includes the name, type, and path of the data object.</p>

<p>For groups, general metadata also includes the name, type, and size of all
the members of the group. The following figure shows an example of the general
information of a group.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/groupmetadata.png" />
<br />
<b>General properties of an HDF group</b></p>
</center>


<p>For a dataset (or image), the general metadata also includes the dataspace
information (rank, current, and maximum size of each dimension) and datatype
information (type, size, and order).
The following figure shows an example of the metadata for a dataset.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/datasetmetadata.png" />
<br />
<b>General properties of a dataset</b></p>
</center>

<p>
To see the attributes of an object, click the &ldquo;Object Attribute Info&rdquo; tab
in the object's metadata panel. The name, type, size, and value of all attributes
of the selected object are displayed in a table. The following figure shows an example
of the attribute display.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/attributemetadata.png" />
<br /><b>The Attributes tab</b></p></center>

<h2>
<a name="ug04edit"></a>4.5 Edit File and File Structure</h2>
<p>
HDFView allows you to create and save files and to add and delete objects in the
files. <b>Users should be aware that all the changes are made to the actual stored
file. This version does not support the undo operation; editing results cannot
be automatically recovered</b>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="ug04file"></a>4.5.1 Create and Save File</h3>
<p>
The file creation dialog box appears when you choose the
&ldquo;New -> HDF4/5&rdquo; command from the File menu. Choose the path and the
file name you want to create and click the &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button
from the New File dialog box. A new file will be created with an empty root group.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/newfile.png" />
<br /><b>Create New File</b></p></center>

<p>
Select &ldquo;Save As&rdquo; from the File menu to save the currently selected
file into a new file of the same format, i.e. HDF4 to HDF4 or HDF5 to HDF5.
(HDFView does not support HDF4 to HDF5 conversion.)</p>

<p>For HDF5, a new file is written that does not contain the inaccessible
objects, and it packs the unusable space. Thus, the new file may be smaller
than the original. <b>Dataset or attribute values that are object references
can not be updated.</b> For HDF4, a new file is the exact copy, same file
content and file size.</p>

<h3>
<a name="ug04libversion"></a>4.5.2 Setting the Library Version Bounds</h3>
<p>The library version bounds of an HDF5 file can be set by right clicking
the file from treeview, then selecting &ldquo;Set Lib version bounds&rdquo;
from the Context menu and setting the earliest version and latest version.
In order to see the currently set library versions of an HDF5 File,
select the &ldquo;General Object Info&rdquo; tab of the metadata panel and it will display
the library versions that had been set earlier.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="images/versionbounds.png" />
<br /><b>Setting the library version bounds of an HDF5 file</b></p></center>

<h3>
<a name="ug04add"></a>4.5.3 Add and Delete Object</h3>
<p>
All objects in HDFView are created by selecting the "New" command from the Context
menu, accessed by right clicking on any object in the TreeView panel.
</p>

<p>
To create a new group, select the &ldquo;New -> Group&rdquo; command from the
Context menu, then give the name of the new group and the parent group to which the new group
is to be added.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/newgroup.png" />
<br /><b>The New Group dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>By clicking on the &ldquo;more&rdquo; button, the user can set the
options, creation order, and link storage when creating groups. Help buttons
are provided for more information about the options.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/newgroupmore.png" />
<br /><b>Create new group options</b></p></center>

<p>
To create a new dataset, select the &ldquo;New -> Dataset&rdquo; command from the
HDF5 Context menu, or &ldquo;New -> SDS&rdquo; from the HDF4 Context menu, then
specify the name, path, datatype, dataspace, and storage layout and compression
of the new dataset. The current version only supports creating simple datatypes.
This version cannot create an HDF4 VData; however, these types of objects can be
viewed. Supported datatypes include integers (byte, short, int, long), float,
double, and character. For HDF5, it also includes String and Object references.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/newdataset.png" />
<br /><b>The New Dataset dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
To create a new compound dataset (HDF5 only), select the &ldquo;New -> Compound Dataset&rdquo;
command from the Context menu. Then, specify the name, path and template to use
(if applicable), as well as the dataspace, storage layout and compression and
properties of the new dataset. Supported datatypes include integers
(byte, short, int, long), float, double, String and Object reference.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/newcompound.png" />
<br /><b>The New Compound Dataset dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
The &ldquo;New -> Image&rdquo; command from the Context menu allows you to create
an empty image with default image attributes. The new image does not have
any palette attached to it. You can create two kinds of images: an indexed
image with 256 colors and a 24-bit true color image.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/newimage.png" />
<br /><b>The New HDF Image dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
The &ldquo;New -> Datatype&rdquo; command from the Context menu allows you to create
a new committed datatype (HDF5 only). Committed datatypes are able to be shared
among datasets within an HDF5 file.
</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/newdatatype.png" />
<br /><b>The New Datatype dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
The &ldquo;New -> Link&rdquo; command from the Context menu allows you to
create links to objects (HDF5 only). Three types of links can be created:
hard, soft, or external. Hard links and soft links are links
to objects in the same HDF5 file. External links are links to objects in a
different HDF5 file. Soft links and external links are symbolic links and
are allowed to dangle, meaning that the target object need not exist at
the time the link is created. A Help button is provided for more information
about links.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/newlink.png" />
<br /><b>The New Link dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
The type for a soft link or external link object that links to a
non-existing target object is unknown, so it will have a different
icon: &lsquo;<img src="images/question.png" />&rsquo;
The user can change the target object being linked to by selecting the
link object from the tree view and select the &ldquo;General Object Info&rdquo; tab in
the Metadata panel. In the Properties dialog box, edit the
&ldquo;Link to Target&rdquo; field to change the target object.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/linktargetinfo.png" />
<br /><b>Change the target object for a dangling link</b></p></center>

<p>
To delete objects from the tree, you first select the objects, then choose the
&ldquo;Delete&rdquo; command from the Context menu. A confirmation dialog
appears to verify that you want to delete the selected objects.
<b>Deleting an object from an HDF4 file is not supported</b>.
</p>

<p>
Deleting an HDF5 object calls the H5Gunlink() function of the HDF5 library. The unlink
function removes the link, and when an object has no remaining links, it can be deleted.
However, the HDF5 library does not currently reclaim the space in the file. This means
that the size of the file does not shrink even though objects are removed. (Users are
cautioned that repeatedly creating and deleting objects with HDFView can cause the HDF5
file to grow.) To get rid of the inaccessible objects, you have to save the current
file into a new file and rename the new file to the current file.</p>


<h3>
<a name="ug04copy"></a>4.5.4 Copy and Paste Object</h3>
<p>
HDFView allows you to copy an object and paste it in the same file or a different file
of the same type. To copy and paste an HDF5 object from the tree, select
the object and then select the &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; command from the Context
menu. You then select a group by right clicking on the group to which the
object is to be pasted. After you select the &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; command, the
object is copied into the selected group. HDFView does not allow
you to copy/paste an object of different format. The &ldquo;Paste&rdquo;
command will create a new object in the selected group instead of
making a hard link.</p>

<p>
You can also select multiple objects in the tree and apply the copy/paste action to
the selected objects. Selection can be contiguous and discontiguous. To make a
contiguous selection, click on the first object, then click on the second object while
holding down the Shift key. All the objects between the two objects will be selected
inclusively. To make a discontiguous selection, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking
the objects with the left mouse button. The objects being clicked will be selected.
The rest of the operation of copying/pasting multiple objects is the same as that of
copying/pasting a single object.</p>

<p>
Copying a group will also copy all the descendents of the group. Copying a root
group is not allowed.</p>

<h3>
<a name="ug04move"></a>4.5.5 Move Object</h3>
<p>HDFView allows you to move an object within the same HDF5 file from
one location to another. Moving objects from one file to another file is
not supported by HDFView. To move an HDF5 object from the tree, right click
the object and then select the &ldquo;Cut&rdquo; command from the Context
menu. You then select a group by a right click on the group where the
object is to be moved. Select the &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; command, the object
is then moved into the selected group.</p>
<p>
You can also select multiple objects in the tree and apply the move action to
the selected objects. Selection can be contiguous and discontiguous.</p>
<p>
Moving a group will also move all the descendents of the group. Moving a root
group is not allowed. <b>Moving objects is not supported by HDF4 Files</b>.</p>


<h3>
<a name="ug04attribute"></a>4.5.6 Add, Delete and Modify Attribute</h3>
<p>
To add an attribute, click the &ldquo;Add Attribute&rdquo; button on the &ldquo;Object Attribute Info&rdquo; tab in
the object's metadata panel. You can create an attribute of a string, scalar,
and 1D array of simple datatypes. Attributes of multiple dimensions or a compound
datatype are not supported.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="images/newattribute.png" />
<br /><b>The New Attribute dialog box</b></p></center>

<p>
To change the value of an attribute, type the new value into the cell. Only
string and scalar attributes can be modified. The new value must be interpretable
as a value of the correct type for the attribute. For a string value, the value
typed will be truncated to the size of the attribute if it is longer than the
declared size of the attribute. A valid data value must follow the rules specified
by the section <a href="ug05spreadsheet.html#ug05change">5.4 Change Data Value</a>.</p>

<p>
To change the name of an attribute, right-click the attribute in the &ldquo;Object Attribute Info&rdquo; tab in
the object's metadata panel. Note: once the attribute name is changed, it cannot be changed again until
the file is closed and reopened.</p>
<p>
To delete an attribute, select the attribute and click the &ldquo;Delete&rdquo;
button in the &ldquo;Object Attribute Info&rdquo; tab in
the object's metadata panel. <b>Deleting an attribute of an HDF4 object is not supported</b>.</p>
