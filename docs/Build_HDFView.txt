How to Build HDFView from Source

Below are the instructions for building HDFView from source.
Please note that you need ANT and a Java environment installed,
   see http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html for ANT installation help.

Download the following:

ANT pre-built binary from the Ant web page http://ant.apache.org/
HDF4 and HDF5 binaries
HDFView source code

Install ANT:
  1. Uncompress the downloaded file into a directory.
  2. Set environmental variables JAVA_HOME to your Java environment,
     ANT_HOME to the directory you uncompressed Ant to,
     and add ${ANT_HOME}/bin (Unix) or %ANT_HOME%/bin (Windows) to your PATH.
     See Setup for details.
  3. Optionally, from the ANT_HOME directory
     run ant -f fetch.xml -Ddest=system to get the library dependencies of most
     of the Ant tasks that require them. If you don't do this, many of the
     dependent Ant tasks will not be available. See Optional Tasks for details
     and other options for the -Ddest parameter.

The ANT executable can be found in the bin directory.
Only the bin and lib directories are required to run Ant.

Install HDF4 and HDF5 according to the install instructions.
Once installed you will find the lib directories containing the built libraries.

Uncompress the HDFView source code and either set the HDFLIBS, HDF5LIBS environment variable
to the install location of HDF, HDF5. Or edit the "build.properties" file
in the top HDFView source directory. Change the path for "hdf.lib.dir" to the
library path of your uncompressed HDF installation, and change the path for "hdf5.lib.dir" to the
library path of your uncompressed HDF5 installation. Then save the file.
For example,

     #hdf.lib.dir = ${env.HDFLIBS}/lib
     #hdf5.lib.dir = ${env.HDF5LIBS}/lib
     hdf.lib.dir = /<MYPATH>/HDF_Group/HDF/4.2.16/lib
     hdf5.lib.dir = /<MYPATH>/HDF_Group/HDF5/1.14.2/lib

From the top HDFView source code directory run: /<path to ANT executable>/ant run

From the top HDFView source code directory run: /<path to ANT executable>/ant binaryPackage

Go into the build/dist directory that gets created to find the HDFView distribution.
For example, HDFView-3.3.1-Linux_64.tar.gz.

Uncompress the HDFView binary and bring up HDFView by executing the bin/HDFView command.
