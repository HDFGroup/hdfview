File search location process in HDFView:

# Default command line invocation of HDFView.
java -Djava.library.path="INSTALLDIR/lib/app:INSTALLDIR/lib/app/ext" -Dhdfview.root="INSTALLDIR/lib/app" -cp "INSTALLDIR/lib/app/*" hdf.view.HDFView "ARGS"
#    INSTALLDIR is the installation folder of the HDFView package.
#    ARGS are one or more of the following (noted by *);
       Usage:
           java(w)
           -Djava.library.path="INSTALLDIR/lib/app:INSTALLDIR/lib/app/ext"
           -Dhdfview.root="INSTALLDIR/lib/app"
           -cp "INSTALLDIR/lib/app/*"
       *        -Dhdf.hdf5lib.H5.hdf5lib="your HDF5 library path"
       *        -Dhdf.hdflib.HDFLibrary.hdflib="your HDF4 library path"
           hdf.view.HDFView
       *        -root "the directory where the HDFView is installed"
       *        -start "the directory HDFView searches for files"
       *        -geometry or -g "the preferred window size as WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF"
       *        -java.version "show the version of jave used to build the HDFView and exit"
       *        [filename] "the file to open"

The following locations are involved in where the working directory for a file search dialog will begin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 INITIAL WORKING DIRECTORY
   A. A system property, hdfview.workdir, which will be used as the initial working directory.
      This would require adding a define to the command line invocation of HDFView;
        java ... -Dhdfview.workdir="some/path" ...
   B. A specified directory as the value to the startDir argument from the command line invocation of HDFView.
      java ... hdf.view.HDFView startDir=some_location "ARGS"
   C. A directory specified by the system property, user.dir.
      which is usually the current user location HDFView was launched

   The difference between A and B is that the -startDir=some_location can be passed into a script containing the command line.

 ACTIVE WORKING DIRECTORY
   A. The initial working directory as described above.
   B. The directory used to load a file specified as an argument on the command line invocation of HDFView.
      java ... hdf.view.HDFView startDir=some_location "ARGS"
   C. A location saved in the HDFView property file, .hdfview3.3.1 in the user home directory.
      work.dir=dir_path
      This is property is only set by using the "User Options" dialog.
   D. The last directory used to load a file using the HDFView file search dialog.
   E. Using the "User Options" dialog to reset the working directory:
      1. To the user home directory.
      2. To the system identified working directory.
      3. To a directory selected by the user using a file system browse dialog or typed into a text box.
