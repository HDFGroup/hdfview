Week 3-4: Phase 2A (2.4-2.6) + Phase 2B (2.8-2.9) + Phase 2D (2.24-2.25)
Week 5-6: Phase 2A (2.7) + Phase 2B (2.10-2.11) + Phase 2C (2.14-2.16)
Week 7-8: Phase 2B (2.12-2.13) + Phase 2C (2.17-2.19)
Week 9-10: Phase 2C (2.20) + Integration and documentation
```

### **Critical Dependencies**
1. **JUnit 5 Infrastructure** (2A.2.1-2.2) → **CI/CD Core** (2B.2.8-2.9)
