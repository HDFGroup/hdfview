/**
 * A CompoundDS is a dataset with compound datatype.
 * <p>
 * A compound datatype is an aggregation of one or more datatypes. Each member
 * of a compound type has a name which is unique within that type, and a
 * datatype of that member in a compound datum. Compound datatypes can be nested,
 * i.e. members of a compound datatype can be some other compound datatype.
 * <p>
 * For more details on compound datatypes,
 * see <b> <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/UG/HDF5_Users_Guide-Responsive%20HTML5/index.html">HDF5 User's Guide</a> </b>
 * <p>
 * Since Java cannot handle C-structured compound data, data in a compound dataset
 * is loaded in to an Java List. Each element of the list is a data array that
 * corresponds to a compound field. The data is read/written by compound field.
 * <p>
 * For example, if compound dataset "comp" has the following nested structure,
 * and member datatypes
 *
 * <pre>
 * comp --&gt; m01 (int)
 * comp --&gt; m02 (float)
 * comp --&gt; nest1 --&gt; m11 (char)
 * comp --&gt; nest1 --&gt; m12 (String)
 * comp --&gt; nest1 --&gt; nest2 --&gt; m21 (long)
 * comp --&gt; nest1 --&gt; nest2 --&gt; m22 (double)
 * </pre>
 *
 * The data object is a Java list of six arrays: {int[], float[], char[],
 * Stirng[], long[] and double[]}.
