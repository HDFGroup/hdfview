# HDFView Improvement Plan

This document outlines high-level improvement suggestions for the HDFView project based on analysis of the current codebase, build system, and development workflow.

## 1. Build System Modernization

### Current Issues
- **Dual Build Systems**: Both Ant (legacy) and Maven (current) exist, causing confusion
- **CI/CD Mismatch**: GitHub Actions workflows still use Ant while development uses Maven
- **Native Library Management**: Manual setup via `build.properties` with local file paths
- **Platform Dependencies**: SWT platform-specific dependencies are commented out in Maven

### High-Level Improvements
- **Complete Maven Migration**: Remove Ant build files and fully migrate CI/CD to Maven
- **Unified Build Configuration**: Single source of truth for dependencies and build configuration
- **Automated Native Library Management**: Use Maven profiles and dependency management for HDF libraries
- **Platform-Specific Builds**: Enable proper platform-specific SWT dependency resolution
- **Dependency Management**: Migrate from local repository approach to proper Maven Central dependencies where possible

## 2. Development Experience Enhancement

### Current Issues
- **Manual Environment Setup**: Developers need to manually configure native library paths
- **Platform-Specific Complexity**: Different setup requirements across Windows, macOS, Linux
- **No Containerized Development**: No Docker or dev container support
- **Limited Documentation**: Minimal developer onboarding documentation

### High-Level Improvements
- **Developer Containers**: Create VS Code devcontainer and Docker Compose setup for consistent development environment
- **Automated Setup Scripts**: Platform-specific setup scripts for native libraries and dependencies
- **Enhanced Developer Documentation**: Comprehensive getting-started guide with common troubleshooting
- **IDE Configuration**: Standard IDE configurations (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code) for consistent development experience
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated code formatting and basic quality checks

## 3. Technology Stack Modernization

### Current Issues
- **Outdated UI Framework**: Eclipse SWT is dated and has limited cross-platform consistency
- **Legacy Testing**: JUnit 4 instead of JUnit 5
- **Limited Modern Java Features**: Not leveraging Java 21 features effectively
- **No Modern Build Tools**: Could benefit from Gradle's advanced dependency management

### High-Level Improvements
- **UI Framework Evaluation**: Assess migration to JavaFX for better cross-platform consistency and modern UI patterns
- **Testing Framework Upgrade**: Migrate to JUnit 5 with improved parameterized testing and modern assertions
- **Modern Java Features**: Leverage records, sealed classes, pattern matching, and virtual threads where appropriate
- **Build Tool Assessment**: Evaluate Gradle migration for better dependency management and build performance
- **Modular Architecture**: Better leverage Java Platform Module System (JPMS)

## 4. Code Quality and Maintainability

### Current Issues
- **Limited Static Analysis**: No visible CheckStyle, SpotBugs, or similar tools
- **Code Coverage**: No automated code coverage reporting
- **Inconsistent Testing**: Primarily UI tests, limited unit testing
- **Code Formatting**: Uses clang-format for Java (unusual approach)

### High-Level Improvements
- **Static Analysis Integration**: Add SpotBugs, PMD, and CheckStyle with CI/CD integration
- **Code Coverage Reporting**: Implement JaCoCo with coverage thresholds and reporting
- **Testing Strategy**: Increase unit test coverage and implement integration testing
- **Code Formatting Standardization**: Consider migration to standard Java formatters (Google Java Format or similar)
- **Architectural Testing**: Add ArchUnit for architecture compliance testing
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated JavaDoc generation and publishing

## 5. Architecture and Performance

### Current Issues
- **Monolithic UI Architecture**: Tight coupling between UI and data models
- **Performance with Large Files**: SWT can be slow with large HDF datasets
- **Synchronous I/O**: Likely blocking UI thread operations
- **Limited Extensibility**: No plugin architecture for extending functionality

### High-Level Improvements
- **Architectural Refactoring**: Implement MVP/MVC pattern with better separation of concerns
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Move file operations to background threads with progress indicators
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement intelligent caching for large HDF file operations
- **Plugin Architecture**: Design extensible plugin system for custom data viewers and editors
- **Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage for large datasets
- **Reactive Programming**: Consider reactive streams for handling large data updates

## 6. Distribution and Packaging

### Current Issues
- **Manual Platform Builds**: No automated cross-platform build process
- **No Modern Packaging**: Missing native installer generation
- **No Container Distribution**: No Docker images for server deployments
- **Complex Deployment**: Requires manual native library setup

### High-Level Improvements
- **Native Packaging**: Implement jpackage for native installers (Windows MSI, macOS DMG, Linux DEB/RPM)
- **Container Images**: Docker images for headless HDF processing and web-based viewing
- **Automated Releases**: GitHub Actions for automated cross-platform releases
- **Self-Contained Applications**: Bundle native libraries with application distributions
- **Web Distribution**: Consider web-based viewer using WebAssembly for native libraries

## 7. User Experience and Accessibility

### Current Issues
- **Dated Look and Feel**: SWT provides dated appearance across platforms
- **Limited Accessibility**: No visible accessibility features
- **Complex UI Navigation**: Could benefit from modern UI patterns
- **No Dark Mode**: Missing modern UI theme support

### High-Level Improvements
- **Modern UI Design**: Implement contemporary design patterns and themes
